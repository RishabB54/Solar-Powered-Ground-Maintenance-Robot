# Solar-Powered-Ground-Maintenance-Robot 

This project involved developing a working model of solar powered grass cutting and collecting robot. 
The major programming was done using Arduino IDE and esp 8266.

The model designed had the following functionalities: 
-It was connected through a bluetooth transmitter so it could be controlled remotely by voice or app 
-It had a collection mechanism involving a high powered motor to sweep 
-An onstacle avoiding system was installed by the means of an infrared sensor .
